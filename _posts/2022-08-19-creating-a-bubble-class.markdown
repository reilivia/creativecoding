In this blog post I will explain my thought proccess in understanding class and array by going through a p5js tutorial by [happycoding][happycoding]. Then I will explain my plan in applying my research into my assignment 1.

# First Encounter with .js Class
Coming into this, I have experience working with classes in HTML and CSS. Therefore, I was a bit confuse with class in javascript. The main reason is with how you need to set up a variable first, then add the class functions.

# Plan for Assignment 1
Why do I follow through this tutorial? Because I want to learn the base knowledge of creating a class in p5js.

One of my plans for assignment 1 is to create a class for bubbles. The bubbles will float around the canvas and have a radial blue gradient.

# Following [happycoding][happycoding] Tutorials 

In the tutorial, I started with creating a bouncing circle with the draw function and then convvert it into a class function. Then, change the main variable into array and add a loop function to make x number of bouncing circles.

Overall, the tutorials by [happycoding][happycoding] is not that different from the one I get in creative coding class about class and array. However, by walking through it on my own pace with at least a small knowledge of javascript class, i was able to understand it better.
