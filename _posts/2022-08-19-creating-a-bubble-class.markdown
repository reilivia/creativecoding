In this blog post I will explain my thought proccess in understanding class and array by going through a p5js tutorial by [happycoding][happycoding]. Then I will explain my plan in applying my research into my assignment 1.

# First Encounter with .js Class
Coming into this, I have experience working with classes in HTML and CSS. Therefore, I was a bit confuse with class in javascript. The main reason is with how you need to set up a variable first, then add the class functions.

# Plan for Assignment 1
Why do I follow through this tutorial? Because I want to learn the base knowledge of creating a class in p5js.

One of my plans for assignment 1 is to create a class for bubbles. The bubbles will float around the canvas and have a radial blue gradient.
