To start with, I was scolling down the examples in the p5js website and found the noise wave examples. I copied the code and try to figure out what is happening in that code.

# Why use Begin Shape?
The code uses beginShape() to create a shape using vertex. Two of the vertex will be a noise line, while the other two are used to fill half of the canvas.

# What is Map and why use it in this code?
Coming into this research, I have no knowledge about map. Therefore I did some research about what map is by watching a [YouTube video The Coding Train][map-1] and the [p5js map reference][map-2].

# What is offset value?


# What is Increment?


# Why does the y offset is outside the function, while the x offset is inside?
