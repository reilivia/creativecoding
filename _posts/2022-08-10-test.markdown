To start with, I was scolling down the examples in the p5js website and found the noise wave examples. I copied the code and try to figure out what is happening in that code.

# Why use Begin Shape?
The code uses beginShape() to create a shape using vertex. Two of the vertex will be a noise line, while the other two are used to fill half of the canvas.

# What is Map and why use it in this code?
Coming into this research, I have no knowledge about map. Therefore I did some research about what map is by watching a YouTube video called [The map() Function - p5.js Tutorial][map-1] by The Coding Train and the [p5js map reference][map-2].

From there, I learnt that the map function in the code is meant to map the noise with 0-1 value on the canvas. I tried to change the value of the canvas several times and ended up with setting it into half of the canvas.

# What is offset value?
When encountered with an unfamliar code such as noise, the first thing i notice is the y offset on top of the sketch. To know what is an offset value, I tried to see [p5js noise reference][noise-1]. Unfortunately, there isn't any detailed explanation about offset in that page. So, i tried watching a YouTube video called [2D Noise - Perlin Noise and p5.js Tutorial][map-1] by The Coding Train.

# What is Increment?


# Why does the y offset is outside the function, while the x offset is inside?
