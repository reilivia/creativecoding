## Plan for Assignment 2?
For assignment 2, I have to stick with p5.js. At first I want to use canvas API in javascript and abandoned the p5.js. However, I spent too much time figuring how to use canvas API to create recursion. In the end, I am back to the p5.js for this assignment.

## Documentation
In general, there are three (3) main design choices for my assignment 2 design. Check out the details on the link down bellow:
1. [Mouse Interaction][mouse-interaction]
2. [Recursive Rectangle][recursive-rectangle]
3. [Audio Button][audio-button]



[mouse-interaction]: 
[recursive-rectangle]: 
[audio-button]:
